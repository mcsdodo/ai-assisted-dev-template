#### ADR-001: Example - Template file structure

**Context:** This is an example entry showing the decision format. New users benefit from seeing a concrete example rather than just a comment template.

**Decision:** Delete this entry when starting your project and replace with your own decisions.

**Reasoning:** Having a real example helps new users understand the format better than a comment template alone. The format shown here (Context → Decision → Reasoning) captures the essential "why" that makes decision records valuable for future reference.
